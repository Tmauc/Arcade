# Arcade
Arcade - EPITECH project. Arcade is a gaming platform: a program that lets the user choose a game to play and keeps a register of player scores. To be able to deal with the elements of your gaming plateform at run-time, your graphics libraries and your games must be implemented as dynamic libraries, loaded at runtime. Each GUI available for the program must be used as a shared library that will be loaded and used dynamically by the main program.
